#+TITLE: That’s a Mighty Big Postcard, Mr. Ryan

From http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/08/thats-a-mighty-big-postcard-mr-ryan/:

Matt Yglesias has unkind words today for Paul Ryan’s alleged “tax return
on a postcard.” As he notes, we pretty much already have this in the
Form 1040EZ, which would fit on a postcard if it weren’t for added fluff
like room for your name and address and spaces for you to sign at the
bottom. If anything, though, I think Yglesias is too kind.
