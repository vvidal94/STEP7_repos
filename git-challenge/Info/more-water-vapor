Humans have begun an international project to move water around the
world, far more ambitious than any network of aqueducts or hydroelectric
dams ever constructed or conceived. The drivers of this global system
are billowing vapors, which trap heat and propel the world’s water
faster and farther around the globe. The first results of this project
may already be seen in the outrageous rainfall totals of storms like
Hurricane Harvey, or in landslides on remote mountain hillsides, and
even in the changing saltiness of the oceans.

The Earth system is getting warmer. Water is evaporating faster. There’s
more of it in the air. It’s moving through the system faster. As a
result, the coming centuries will play out under a new atmospheric
regime, one with more extreme rain, falling in patterns unfamiliar to
those around which civilization has grown.
